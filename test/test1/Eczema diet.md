**Try an Elimination Diet**

How do you know if what you’re eating or drinking is causing your eczema to flare up? Typically, if you have any [food sensitivities](https://www.thedermgroup.com/blog/skin-smart-eating-habits-start-here-2), you’ll have a reaction somewhere between 30 minutes to more than a couple of days after ingesting it. This can make it difficult to pin point.

If you are not sure what is causing your flare up, you can try an elimination diet. Add one of these common culprits to your diet and monitor your reaction over a few weeks. Track your body’s response, if any. If you do not discover any noticeable effects, add the next ingredient and test again. If you do discover an ingredient that is causing your eczema flare ups, it’s time to remove it from your diet completely.

I think, its impractical to start a complete elimination diet.
Im already restricted with meat.
getting rid of wheat, like pasta for weeks, is a bit much.
