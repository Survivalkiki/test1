regimented lives

So I believe that for an organism to thrive, it needs to be to a large extent, left alone and allowed to thrive. 
So if you live a life full of rules and restrictions, the life will be bound and more attached than ever.

However, if the life is provided with the right amount of restriction and rules. It can thrive. Ideally, you want to feed it well. And then have certain practices which strengthen its capabilities.

When we think about the mind, I think a lot of it is down to the connection to the body.
Having said that. channeling the mind in such a way will produce a certain outcome.

So if you practice using the mind to create a mental capability, You will build that muscle or capability.

practice means bringing your mind back to a certain practice, in order to create a certain capability.

Were building pathways, which make the task easier and more efficient. (hence the name.)

If the mind is forced to do something with too high resistance, it will not be able to sustain the practice because of lack of motivation and energy.To be more accurate, the resistance starts to become too much to handle, too unpleasant, to properly digest. 

The act of doing something with a little resistance actually resolves some of it, because there is less [[reaction]] to it.
That means you're increasing capabilities in terms of emotions and in terms of the action.

There are unpleasant things during practice, like emotions which can make things unpleasant.
Having these emotions doesnt mean the mind isnt gaining capabilities in practice.
Its just a wrinkly branch that kind of hangs around. Of course, to make things a little more pleasant,
 you could attempt to give it a little prune.

For example people like nakamura, who say theyre so bad at chess sometimes. Despite being able to destroy almost everyone
