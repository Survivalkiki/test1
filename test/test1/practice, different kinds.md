What makes good practice?

Ive heard a lot of top athletes say they just train more than others.

kobe says practice should be harder than the real game.

A lot of it comes down to stress. How can you "stress" the mind and body in such a way that it will grow and adapt.

If you push the mind or body too far, then theres a chance the mind will start pushing back and it will try to restore equalibrium.
If you push it a little bit, it will start adapting.

Its also not about doing an immediate expansion. Its more about slowly pushing the boundaries day by day. so the body and mind can get used to the stress.
Its having the discpline to stick to long term.

Having a [[Habit]] is about creating consistent practice in an expanded form.
ideally you slowly expand it. For example, in chess. 

You can expand it by paying more attention/[[focus]] in a position/ mental state that you don't usually. 
You can expand it by studying for longer



If you dont have consistent practice it implies that theres a restriction which is limiting your abilities in that area. this constriction is not just preventing practice, but it probably interferes elsewhere
